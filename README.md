Welcome, brave Helldivers, to the "Key to Victory."
Spreading democracy requires practice.
Have you ever stopped mid-fight because your thick-ass fingers pressed the wrong key?
You need this, and democracy needs you.

Disclaimers:
This game is still under development because I have limited knowledge of HTML and CSS, so I used ChatGPT to create this game.
Currently, the game can only be played using arrow keys (WASD will be added in the future as I am learning).
More features will be added, such as the ability to select multiple key sets simultaneously for a more immersive gaming experience, adding key press sounds, and so on.
FEEL FREE TO COPY/FORK THIS CODE; I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM DOING EITHER, LMAO.
